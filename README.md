# Fine-tuning BERT Model

This repository contains code and resources for fine-tuning the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The project demonstrates how to adapt pre-trained BERT models for downstream applications such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or named entity recognition using Python and PyTorch.

## Introduction

BERT is a powerful transformer-based language model that has achieved state-of-the-art results in many NLP benchmarks. This repository provides tools and scripts to fine-tune BERT on custom datasets, making it easy to apply BERT to your own NLP problems.

## Features

- Supports fine-tuning for text classification and related tasks
- Easy configuration and training scripts
- Evaluation and metrics reporting
- Example notebooks for experimentation
- Modular design for extending to other transformer models

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shashankkusu/Fine-tuning-Bert-Model.git
    cd Fine-tuning-Bert-Model
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Replace `<path/to/data>` and other placeholders with your actual paths and parameters.

### Training

```bash
python train.py --model bert-base-uncased --data <path/to/data> --epochs 3 --batch_size 32
